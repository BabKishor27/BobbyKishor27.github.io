### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    One of my favorite labs to complete was Lab 4 part 2 as it was the first lab involving if statements. It was the first time I had the opportunity to truly practice if and else statements. Additionally, the lab was centered around a HiLo game where there is a secret number to guess, so having to establish lines of code that tell you if you're guess for the number is too high or too low made for a lab that was very enjoyable.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 1 was another one of my favorite labs to complete as it was one of the first to truly have a focus on argument counters. With the lab being about sandwhich ingredients and having us assign argument numbers to the different types of ingredients (strings) we could potentially make, it made for great practice in assigning variables and terms to certain parts of a desired sentence/result. Additionalyl, the lab as a whole was also  one of the simpler ones which made for a very relaxed class session. 

* Lab 9
 
    Lab 9 part 2 was another one of my favorite labs to perform as it combined both of the things that Lab 4 part 2 and Lab 6 part 1 focused on in a way, strings and boolean statements. With Lab 9 part 2 being about two different philosophers' schedules and making sure they do not align, we had to use boolean statements as well as examine the strings we used to make sure that they didn't fall at the same time. With it being a lab that is brushing up on our practice on the two different concepts, completing it wasn't all that harder than other labs due to the experience which ultimately made for a satisfying session completing it.
